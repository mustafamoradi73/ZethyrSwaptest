Since Zethyr Exchange is fully decentralized and thus forever running on the TRON blockchain, you can still use older version of Zethyr Exchange if you wish to. However, to ensure that you have the best trading experience, we will discontinue our support of exchange 1.0 effectively today. Please cancel all your current pending orders and unstake all your ZTR to avoid any inconvenience. Zethyr Exchange 1.0 can be accessed via the link below.',
